# Wisconsin Autonomous Perception Coding Challenge

## Methodology

First, I applied a filter for the color of the cone. I was pretty lucky that the color of the cone was ditinct enough from the rest of the image that I was able to get only information from the code after a single filter. Then, I used find contours to get clusters of points that matched to the clusters given to us by the filter. I separated the two sets of cones by simply separating the points on the left and right side of the image. Finally, I fit a line two both sets of points and displayed the line on the final image.

## What I tried

After doing some searching online for how these sorts of tasks are performed, I stumbled across Object detection with Generalized Ballard and Guil Hough Transform. I spent a fair amount of time attempting this method, but I simply wasnt savvy enough with the openCV functions and wasnt able to get any results from this method.

## What Libraries are used

I used openCV and numpy
